<ul>
    <li>
        Succeeded the short-lived Sui Dynasty (581–618 CE), which reunified China 
        after centuries of division, laying the groundwork for the Tang’s long reign.
    </li>
    <li>
        Li Yuan (later Emperor Gaozu) officially founded the Tang in 618 CE, seizing 
        power amid mass rebellions and capitalizing on the Sui’s collapse.
    </li>
    <li>
        Early Tang rulers sought to refine and expand upon Sui innovations, aiming 
        to stabilize the empire and avoid repeating the Sui’s administrative 
        overreach.
    </li>
</ul>

    </a>
</div>
<ul>
    <li>
        Under Li Yuan and Emperor Taizong, the military was significantly strengthened, 
        leading to successful territorial expansions (campaigns in Mongolia and 
        along the Silk Road).
    </li>
    <li>
        Confucian bureaucracy was established, emphasizing merit-based 
        appointments over nepotism, thereby creating a stable 
        administrative system.
    </li>
    <li>
        While these reforms contributed to a centralized government and bolstered the 
        empire’s power, they also laid the groundwork for future challenges tied to 
        military ambitions and concentrated authority.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Refined Porcelain Production:</strong>
        Tang artisans perfected ceramic making techniques, leading to innovations in glaze 
        formulas and kiln technology. Their high-quality porcelain became highly prized 
        both domestically and along the Silk Road.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Agricultural Advances:</strong>
        The Tang state expanded canal networks and introduced higher yield grain varieties,

        Although rotary fans for air conditioning were first invented by Ding Huan 
        (180CE) during the Han Dynasty, Emperor Xuanzong took this concept further 
        in 747 by building a “Cool Hall” in the imperial palace. This hall 
        featured water powered fan wheels and water jets from fountains.
